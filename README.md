# Image Classification with CNN

## Objective
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset
- **CIFAR-10**: Contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- Classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CNN-Image-Classification.git
Install dependencies:

### **Extending the Project**
- Try using the MNIST dataset instead of CIFAR-10.
- Experiment with deeper networks or different optimizers like `SGD`.
- Save the model for future inference.
- Add explanations for hyperparameters in the README.
